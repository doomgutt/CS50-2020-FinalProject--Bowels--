# CS50-2020-FinalProject--Bowels--
Final Project for the CS50 2020 track course called [bowels]

## Description

[bowels] is a game (or virtual environment) whose main purpose is to explore subjective sensorimotor experiences of the agents in this world.

Basically, the goal was to put the humans and a potential AI on a level footing by making sure that the players' senses and actions are the same regardless of whether they are inside or outside the computer.

To achieve this, players perceive the world through 'sensory grids' of sort which let them make use of senses such as sight (done), smell (done) and sound (to be added).

## Gameplay

There are multiple agents. Following the theme of an unnerving 'biopunk' aesthetic I decided to name my agents after various body parts. Thus so far we have:

- Toe [controlled by arrow keys]
- Nostril [controlled by 'ijkl']
- Ear [controlled by 'wasd']

Currently, Toe's goal is to find the exit of the map (at which point the game simply resets), and the rest of the agents are trying to 'catch' and 'eat' the Toe in which case the Toe's sensory inputs go blank. One can reset the game manually then by pressing 'r'.

Misc Controls:
ESC - quits the game
r - resets the game

## Critcisms and ideas

A criticism has been posed that the sensory grids are too crude for humans to comfortably navigate their way around the map. I'm not sure at this point whether this is a feature of a drawback. Perhaps In the future I will update the 'sensory grids' to allow more precise senses.

## ToDo

I have still yet to add any meaninful gameplay outside of some agents eating others and the Toes trying to escape.

Potentially planned are:
- capabilities of using gamepads so that people don't have to crowd around one keyboard
- multiple Toes, or multiple of other agents
- collectables to pick up for a win condition
- barrels or other object to hide behind
- movable objects
- traps?
- feel free to suggest stuff
